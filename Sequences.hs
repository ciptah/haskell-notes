-- A convergent sequence is always bounded. If convergent, then bounded.
-- NOTE: not the converse: Bounded does not imply convergent.
--   HOWEVER, bounded does imply existence of convergent subsequence
--   (Bolzano-Weierstrass). Will define later.
-- "A sequence is bounded" means the image of the values of the sequence
-- is bounded.

-------------- Application: Turning Sets into Lists -----------
--For certain sets (countable sets with totally ordered elements)
--we can define how to turn a set into a Haskell (possibly) infinite list.

-- THIS IS WRONG, because some sequences can only be monotonically decreasing.
badS :: (Ord a, Ord b) => Set a -> Set b -> Set (Boxed a b)
badS a b = mappers a b % \bf -> let f = compile bf in
  forAll (a тип a) $ \(x1, x2) ->
    (x1 < x2 && f x1 < f x2) || (x1 >= x2 && f x1 >= f x2)

-- The correct way of turning a countable set to a list is finding a sequence
-- that is strictly monotone.
order :: (Ord b) => Set b -> Maybe (Sequence b)
order b = pure compile <*> singleton sequences
  where sequences = mappers naturals b % \box -> strictlyMonotone (compile box)

-- Finally, we can turn into a list those sets that have a unique sequencer.
-- With maps it's impossible to get a unique mapper, imagine swapping every
-- two indices with each other.
-- Finite sets are super easy because the inf is guaranteed to be included,
-- so we can just repeatedly build using the inf.
toList :: (Ord a) => Set a -> Maybe [a]
toList set | set == empty = Just [] -- Base case for finite case
           | isFinite set = Just $ minimum : (fromJust $ toList remainder)
           -- Apply the unique sequencer (if available) to [1..]
           | countable set = pure map <*> (order set) <*> pure [1..]
           | otherwise = Nothing
  where minimum = fromJust $ infimum set
        remainder = set `minus` singletonOf minimum

---------------- Lim Sup and Lim Inf - for every BOUNDED sequence, they exist

----------- Cauchy sequences ------------------

                    domain box == naturals && range box `isSubsetOf` naturals &&
                    strictlyIncreasing (compile box)

-- The theorem does not claim any result about unbounded sequences (it could
-- be that they are oscillating) so the result for unbounded is undefined.
-- B-W theorem guarantees the output of this function is never empty
-- for bounded sequences
