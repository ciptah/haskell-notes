-- A convergent sequence is always bounded. If convergent, then bounded.
-- NOTE: not the converse: Bounded does not imply convergent.
--   HOWEVER, bounded does imply existence of convergent subsequence
--   (Bolzano-Weierstrass). Will define later.
-- "A sequence is bounded" means the image of the values of the sequence
-- is bounded.

-- Sequencers are stronger than mappers where the mapping is guaranteed to

-- Finally, we can turn into a list those sets that have a unique sequencer.
-- With maps it's impossible to get a unique mapper.
-- Finite sets are super easy because the inf is guaranteed to be included,
-- so we can just repeatedly build using the inf.
