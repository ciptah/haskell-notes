Math notes using Haskell.

# Why
Math, especially probability, is confusing to me because many terms are overloaded (for example, probability of events vs probability of random variables). By defining concepts as functions in Haskell it helps bring some order.

Another advantage of using Haskell is its ability to specify infinite sets of things, which is useful when writing down the definition of "countable union".

The code's never meant to be run, just compiled. Passing compilation is a good sign that things make sense.
