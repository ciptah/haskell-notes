Math concepts described as Haskell code.

This is just a fun project to learn Haskell and math at the same time. It really
helps me to understand math concepts more when I have to actually write them
in code.

The value of using Haskell is that the code can be type-checked, which may
point out any inconsistency/misunderstanding that I have by failing to compile.

I make no claim for the accuracy of any code I write here.
